# Tesla-APAC-Global-Mobility-Dashboard
## Project Objective
Tesla wants to address global mobility challenges by expanding ethically and efficiently in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region. This project aims to visualize key indicators such as mobile office demand, fleet efficiency, data privacy compliance, and carbon footprint to support Tesla’s strategic decision-making and scalability goals.
## Dataset used
- <a href ="https://github.com/AymanM7/Tesla-APAC-Global-Mobility-Dashboard/blob/main/2EV_Based_Mobile_Offices_Data.xlsx">Dataset</a>

## Questions (KPIs)
- What is the carbon footprint of Tesla’s operations by country?
- Where should Tesla prioritize infrastructure investment based on demand and compliance?
- Compare the carbon emissions between China and India.
- Which country has the highest fleet efficiency?
- How many data points are processed per day in South Korea?
- How does Tesla’s Dojo AI performance vary across the APAC region?
- Relationship between Data points proccesed and Fleet Efficency Percent.
- How does mobile office demand compare between developed countries (e.g., Japan, South Korea) and emerging markets (e.g., India, China)?
- Is there a correlation between high data processing (Dojo AI) and lower carbon footprint in any specific country?
- How does regional privacy enforcement (DPDP scores) influence Tesla’s expansion strategy in the APAC market?

## Process
- Verify Data for any missing values, and sort out same values.
- Ensure data is clean and consistent.
- Utilize Pivot Tables  to identify key trends, segment mobile office demand by country, and summarize regional privacy compliance metrics from the Excel data before visualizing in Tableau.
- Leverage bar charts, scatter plots, filled maps, and symbol maps to clearly represent complex metrics and (KPIS).

## Project Insight
- Japan has the highest data processing capacity with over 250 data points/day and 30% fleet efficiency.
- China leads in carbon footprint, measuring 8,500 units, suggesting a need for green investment.
- Australia and South Korea maintain moderate levels of fleet efficiency around 15–20% with lower carbon output.
- India, while ranking lowest in Dojo AI efficiency, shows the highest mobile office demand (~8,000 requests)—indicating strong market potential despite tech inefficiency.
- Only 3 APAC countries (as shown on the map) fully meet Tesla’s Privacy by Design (DPDP) compliance standards, potentially limiting expansion in non-compliant regions.
- No clear inverse relationship exists between data processing and carbon footprint, indicating AI optimization is not yet reducing emissions in proportion to data efficiency.

## Final Conclusion:
This dashboard serves as a strategic tool for Tesla to evaluate and guide its sustainable expansion across APAC. By combining scalable KPIs with market and compliance data, it helps visualize where Tesla should invest in mobility infrastructure, privacy systems, and Dojo AI optimization. For the future, the dashboard can be enhanced with real-time data feeds, user-interaction filters, and predictive modeling to support ongoing strategic decisions as Tesla further evolves globally.
