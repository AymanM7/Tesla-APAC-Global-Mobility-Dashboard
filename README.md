# Tesla-APAC-Global-Mobility-Dashboard
## Project Objective
Tesla wants to address global mobility challenges by expanding ethically and efficiently in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region. This project aims to visualize key indicators such as mobile office demand, fleet efficiency, data privacy compliance, and carbon footprint to support Tesla’s strategic decision-making and scalability goals.
## Dataset used
- <a href ="https://github.com/AymanM7/Tesla-APAC-Global-Mobility-Dashboard/blob/main/2EV_Based_Mobile_Offices_Data.xlsx">Dataset</a>

## Questions (KPIs)
- What is the carbon footprint of Tesla’s operations by country?
- Where should Tesla prioritize infrastructure investment based on demand and compliance?
- Compare the carbon emissions between China and India.
- Which country has the highest fleet efficiency?
- How many data points are processed per day in South Korea?
- How does Tesla’s Dojo AI performance vary across the APAC region?
- Relationship between Data points proccesed and Fleet Efficency Percent.
- How does mobile office demand compare between developed countries (e.g., Japan, South Korea) and emerging markets (e.g., India, China)?
- Is there a correlation between high data processing (Dojo AI) and lower carbon footprint in any specific country?
- How does regional privacy enforcement (DPDP scores) influence Tesla’s expansion strategy in the APAC market?

## Process
- Verify Data for any missing values, and sort out same values
- Ensure data is clean and consistent.
- Utilize Pivot Tables  to identify key trends, segment mobile office demand by country, and summarize regional privacy compliance metrics from the Excel data before visualizing in Tableau.
- Leverage bar charts, scatter plots, filled maps, and symbol maps to clearly represent complex metrics and (KPIS).
